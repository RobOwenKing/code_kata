# RobOwenKing's Ruby Practice

This repo contains a variety of small projects I've worked on in my free time. I've so far focussed on getting things working, so much of the code could be optimised and refactored.

## Projects
1. Brute force password - A bonus challenge I was set by a TA during my Le Wagon bootcamp. It includes three algorithms for generating all possible combinations of symbols from a given alphabet up to a given length.
2. Data structures \([Readme](https://github.com/RobOwenKing/code_kata/tree/master/data_structures)\) - A TDD-approach to implementing a number of common data structures as Ruby classes. So far: Stack, LinkedList, Queue (using Stacks), Set, Priority Queue, Binary Tree, Minimum Binary Heap.
3. Game of Life - A version of Conway's Game of Life for the command line.
4. Hangman - A game of Hangman, again for the command line. It needs a csv wordlist to be provided.
5. Maths methods - A number of simple methods inspired by common recreational Maths topics.
6. String methods - A number of TDD-built methods to manipulate and analyse strings.
7. Killer sudoku decomp - A tool for helping with "Killer Sudoku" puzzles. Given the total of a cage and how many cells it contains, it returns all valid combinations of numbers.
8. Self-locating string - Given a decimal expansion, it finds any number that indicates its position in the expansion (eg: 3.14 would return "1", a "1" being in position 1). For numbers with more digits, they start at their position.
9. String including numbers - Inspired by a digression during a lecture during my bootcamp, this script includes two ways (one with RegEx, one without), to determine whether a given string includes any digits or not.

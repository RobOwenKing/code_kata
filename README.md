# RobOwenKing's Code Practice

This repo contains a variety of small projects I've worked on in my free time. I've so far focussed on getting things working, so much of the code could be optimised and refactored.

## Projects
1. Brute force password - A bonus challenge I was set by a TA during my Le Wagon bootcamp. It includes three algorithms for generating all possible combinations of symbols from a given alphabet up to a given length.
2. Game of Life - A version of Conway's Game of Life in ruby for the command line.
3. Hangman - A game of hangman, again in ruby for the command line. It needs a csv wordlist to be provided.
4. Sudoku - A simple sudoku app for the browser. Currently users can input a grid and have a brute force algorithm find a solution.
5. Collatz conjecture - Two algorithms based on the conjecture. The first calculates the series from any given starting number, the second records the maximum value attained along the path from a starting point to the 4-2-1 loop.
6. Killer sudoku decomp - A tool for the "killer sudoku" variant of sudoku. Given the total of a cage and how many cells it contains, it returns all valid combinations of numbers.
7. Self-locating string - Given a decimal expansion, it finds any number that indicates its position in the expansion (eg: 3.14 would return "1", a "1" being in position 1). For numbers with more digits, they start at their position.
8. String including numbers - Inspired by a digression during a lecture during my bootcamp, this script includes two ways (one with RegEx, one without), to determine whether a given string includes any digits or not.
